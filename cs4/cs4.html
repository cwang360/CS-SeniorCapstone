			 system, selection of IT security products, firewall benefits and limitations, intruder 
			 detection, correct ways to configure your computer, browser settings, virus settings, 
			 operating system vulnerabilities, strong password techniques, parasite detection, and 
			 encryption techniques.  </p>
		<h2>CS IV Standards</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Understand the fundamentals of an effective computer security system</li>

			<h1>Bid Proposal Project</h1>
			<p>For this project, we were tasked with creating a Bid Proposal for an information security contract. 
			The financial business has 60 employees and is struggling with security issues both internal and external. 
			Employees use laptops and have remote access to the office systems. The bid proposal needs
			to be a turnkey solution for the following problems:
			<ul>
				<li>Equipment is disappearing</li>
				<li>No building or computer room security.</li>
				<li>No policies (AUP)</li>
				<li>No virus protection and experiencing viruses daily</li>
				<li>No intrusion detection and experiencing intrusions daily</li>
				<li>Passwords compromised</li>
				<li>There is an Internet connection but no protection and content filtering</li>
				<li>Sensitive information is being copied from systems</li>
				<li>If a disaster should happen to the building there are no plans to recover</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Describe:</h3>
				<p>
				In order to find solutions to security problems such as no virus protection or intrusion detection, we needed to understand the 
				fundamentals of an effective computer security system and discuss the tools and techniques of computer security.
				We also performed research to identify and recognize the different security 
				products as they provide different security solutions. The research allowed us to find the latest security technologies and formulate
				a business security plan based on them. 
				
				</p>
			<h3>Analyze:</h3>
				<p>
				Before starting the project, we split up the roles and responsibilities. Then, we brainstormed possible solutions to each of the problems
				and performed research on current software or technology. We also had to research and consider the prices and compare different 
				technologies to see which ones were most appropriate for the company. Then, we wrote our individual reports and compiled all of the
				software and technologies in a spreadsheet to determine the budget needed to implement the security solutions. Finally, we shared
				our solutions in a presentation.
				</p>
			<h3>Reflect:</h3>
				<p>
				I worked well with my team members on this project. We were able to split up the work evenly and synthesize what we came up with
				individually. I learned a lot about intrusion detection, building security, agreement user policies, virus protection, password
				security/policy, content filtering software, and disaster recovery.
