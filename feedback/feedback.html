		<h3>Feedback on My Experience</h3>
			<p>I enjoyed all four years of the Computer Science pathway, and it has helped me decide on majoring in Computer Engineering
			in college. I have learned a lot about computer hardware and software, writing code (including computer logic and best practices), 
			computer security, and website development. My favorite parts of the pathway were the ones that involved coding, so I hope to become 
			a software developer or similar.</p>
		<h3>Feedback for Mrs. Mooney</h3>
			<ul>
			<li><span>3 Things to Improve: </span>I think we only had one quick project on using JavaScript in websites, so I think it would be useful
			to spend more time on integrating JavaScript in HTML, especially for creating responsive sites. The simulations in TestOut were great, but it always
			helps to have a more hands-on experience with computer hardware. Therefore, I think we should be able to regularly tinker with physical computer hardware
			while going through the lessons in TestOut or spend more time on physical hardware. </li>
			<li><span>2 Things to Keep: </span>I really enjoyed the unit on website development through the Starbuzz, Lounge, and Segway mini-projects. The 
			textbook was very interactive and fun to work through, so I think you should keep the unit. I also think Edhesive provided very good, comprehensive
			coursework for the AP CSA course, so I think you should keep using Edhesive.</li>
			<li><span>1 Thing to Remove: </span>Although Blown to Bits was interesting to read, it was not really related to the AP CSP course. I think
			you could remove the Blown to Bits summer assignment or at least replace it and move it as summer assignment for CS4, since it was more
			security-related.</li>
			</ul>
