		<h2>AP CSA Course Summary</h2>
			 <p>Students learn object-oriented programming using Java. The emphasis is on problem-solving and algorithm development with hands-on activities.  This course will prepare students for the end-of-course AP Exam. Students also complete CSC 240 JavaScript, a Wilmington University Dual Enrollment course.  </p>
		<h2>AP CSA Standards</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Design and implement computer-based solutions to problems.</li>
				<li>Use and implement commonly used algorithms and data structures.</li>
				<li>Develop and select appropriate algorithms and data structures to solve new problems.</li>
				<li>Write solutions fluently an object-oriented paradigm</li>
				<li>Write, run, test and debug solutions in the Java programming language</li>
				<li>Read and understand programs consisting of several classes and interacting objects</li>
				<li>Read and understand a description of the design and development process</li>
				<li>Understand the ethical and social implications of computer use</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>Describe:</h3>
				<p>This program simulates a checkers board and tests it with sample input. It uses a customized class named
				"Gameboard" to set up a checkers board and functions that are associated with the checkers board, such
				as checking if a move is possible. In main.java, objects of the Gameboard class are made and tested.</p>
			<h3>Analyze:</h3>
				<p>When I first started the assignment, I read through the requirements to understand what I needed to do.
				Then, I created the Gameboard class using the requirements and algorithms needed. I used the Gameboard class in the main
				java file to test it by Gameboard objects and running the algorithms on different scenarios. When I had problems with the code,
				I added flags and looked at the console to see where to debug.</p>
			<h3>Reflect:</h3>
				<p>I learned a lot about using and making classes in Java, which helped me understand the object-oriented
				programming. I also learned about the importance of the 
				console and using it to display test results and debug the program. </p>
