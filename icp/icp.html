				<h3>Describe:</h3>
				<p>Each part of the final project represents a progression through the course of HTML and CSS, improving
				each time. HTML was used for the basic structure and content of the webpage, while CSS was used to add styling.
				Hector's list involved understanding how to organize webpages in directories, linking between
				webpages, heading/paragraph types, and adding images. iFace 
				involved linking within a page, using icons as hyperlinks, ordered and undordered lists, HTML entities for symbols, and
				inline and block quotes. 
				Sports page tested the ability to create inline divs and tables. 
				Hobby page tested the ability to use span tags, borders, tables, divs, quotes, and icons as links.
				Home page (index) tested the ability to create a navigation bar.
				For every webpage, best practices were used and ensured by running through the W3C validator for HTML and CSS.</p>
				<h3>Analyze: </h3>
				<p>The main part of Hector's list was being able to navigate between directories, which allowed me to learn 
				how to link between pages and understand web page structure and the physical aspect of web site construction. I also 
				used basic HTML tags such as the heading and paragraph tags to organize the content, as well as image tags to add images.
				iFace was intended to be a social media-like website with photos, quotes, friends, etc. Since it was one long page, being able
				to link to different parts of the page using icons at the top of the page was very useful. I also learned to format the quotes
				as block quotes and nicknames as inline quotes. For the sports page, the webpage layout and design was a major component.
				Knowing how to place and format divs and tables allows me to organize content in sections of the webpage. For the Hobby page, 
				I wanted to make something new and creative, so I created a fixed background and had the content scroll past it. I also had the
				webpage header and links directly on top of the background image and linked to sections of the page. I used span tags to emphasize
				or mark parts of my paragraphs. To connect all of the pages, I learned to create a navigation bar on the index page, where I 
				used a 2-by-2 table to clearly organize the four parts of the project. Throughout the entire project, I used CSS to style the text,
				page color, borders, tables, backgrounds, placement, etc.</p>
				<h3>Reflect:</h3>
				<p>This project was my favorite part of the year, because I enjoyed being able to create webpages from scratch.
				I was always excited to go through each week's lesson to add another trick to my web design toolbelt. My favorite
				part of the project was the Hobbies page because it represented the culmination of all the skills I had learned.
				I was able to create a fixed background that the page scrolls across, an organized table to display pictures of my
				creations, apply inline styling using span tags, and use icons to link to parts of the page.</p>

				<h3>Describe:</h3>
				<p>I designed the overall structure of the project before developing it with Scratch code. A library
				of characters and fonts was used. Forever loops, if/then statements, broadcasting between sprites, user input,
				and repeat-until loops were used. Variables were created to store the user's response.
				Logical expressions such as "if answer = "no"" were used as well. 
				This project was intended for prospective students, which involved publishing and present it.</p>
				<h3>Analyze:</h3>
				<p>Before coding, I sketched out the basic design I had in mind, which was a simple, easy to follow program 
				that was also engaging. Therefore, I had a welcome screen and allowed the user to choose a character (choices were 
				obtained from a library of Scratch characters).
				When developing the project, I wanted to enable users to interact with a "tour guide," so I decided 
				to prompt the user for responses and used several loops to stall the program until the user responds. I also 
				had to make sure that the program could still work and guide the user if the user enters an invalid response and 
				change the tour according to the user's response, so I used a lot of if-then statements and logic expressions. I used
				variables to store and refer to the user's input, such as a name ("Hi, [name]"). </p>
				<h3>Reflect:</h3>
				<p>I had experience with Scratch before working on this project, so it was not difficult for me.
				I enjoyed creating a virtual "tour" experience of our school and was able to practice my coding skills, such 
				as using loops and logic expressions. I also think it was a great way to practice my design skills to make the program engaging.
				Additionally, I had to make sure the program was user-friendly, easy to navigate, and did not have any "dead-ends." These
				will help me design successful apps or programs in the future.</p>
